# Bouncing Balls Game

## 📖 **Course Information**  

- **Course Title:** Fundamentals of Programming (C++)
- **Supervisors:** Prof. Bijan Vosoughi Vahdat, Prof. Abdullah Arasteh  
- **Semester:** Fall 2023-2024  

This project is the final assignment for the **Fundamentals of Programming** course, where we applied core programming principles to develop a simplified version of the **Bouncing Balls** game.

## 🎮 **Game Overview**

**Bouncing Balls** is a colorful and interactive game where balls bounce around the screen. Players aim to group balls of the same color while they randomly bounce off walls. The game features:

- **Random Ball Placement**: Balls are randomly positioned within the game window.
- **Color Grouping**: Balls of the same color group together using optimized algorithms.
- **Bouncing Effect**: Balls bounce off the window edges, creating a dynamic interaction.

## 🛠️ **Tools and Technologies**

- **C++**: The primary language used to implement the game logic and mechanics.  
- **SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)**: Utilized for graphics rendering, providing a smooth game interface.

## 🚀 **Project Highlights**

- Developed a **Bouncing Balls** game using **C++** and **SDL**.
- Implemented optimized algorithms for **random ball placement** and **grouping same-colored balls** efficiently.
- Focused on creating an engaging user experience with dynamic ball movements and a smooth interface.
